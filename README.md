## 🧮 Science Scoring Algorithm

The science scoring uses an advanced algorithm to maximize points:

- **Sets**: 7 points per complete set of 3 different symbols
- **Individual**: n² points for each symbol (where n = count of that symbol)
- **Wildcards**: Automatically assigned to maximize total score
- **Optimization**: Tests all possible wildcard distributions

Example: 2 Gear + 1 Mason + 3 wildcards = 2² + 4² + 0² + (1 set × 7) = 4 + 16 + 0 + 7 = 27 points
